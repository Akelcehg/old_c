1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,998
And so the...

2
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:05,922
wife is intrigued and...

3
00:00:06,322 --> 00:00:08,422
the next time she's
alone with George

4
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,321
she sees to it that
he tells her himself.

5
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:14,678
Well, it's an oblique approach
but not a bad one, and...

6
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:16,307
very effective.

7
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:17,775
So, I understand.

8
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:19,876
Well, I don't know your husband.

9
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:22,565
And my name is not George, it's Charles.

10
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:23,856
What's yours?

11
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:26,100
-Hilary.
-Hilary?

12
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:28,527
That's a boy's name. 
You don't look like a boy to me.

13
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:30,942
Charlies what?

14
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:33,591
Delacro,
D-E-L-A-C-R-O.

15
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:36,170
-Oh, sounds French.
-It is, was.

16
00:00:36,797 --> 00:00:39,526
Used to be
Delacroix, C-R-O-I-X.

17
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:40,472
But...

18
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:43,359
we Americans are a simple,
straightforward people.

19
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,991
We see an X on the end of
a name and we pronounce it.

20
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:49,754
My grandfather thought Dela-Quacks
sounded like a duck laying an egg,

21
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:50,942
so we cut it off.

22
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:51,961
The X, I mean.

23
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,112
He was born in France. In Tours.

24
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:56,684
Oh now, isn't that odd.

25
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:59,515
I had a French grandfather and
he was born in Turenne,

26
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:00,831
perhaps were cousins?

27
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:02,141
Oh, I doubt that.

28
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:05,798
Your grandfather was probably a
nobleman. Mine was a clockmaker.

29
00:01:07,244 --> 00:01:10,381
And now you're a millionaire,
and I'm a mushroom grower.

30
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:14,949
Oh well, there you are.
That's the way the world wags.

31
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,723
It's a little early to
offer you a cup of tea.

32
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,668
Would you like a drink, or something?

33
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:29,148
I don't really want one, but...

34
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:31,573
accepting a drink means
that I'm now your guest,

35
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:33,185
and not just an intruder,

36
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,254
then, by all means.

37
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:38,217
Yes, well. Perhaps you'd like 
to help yourself.

38
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:39,531
Alright, thank you.

39
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:42,455
I imagine it's something
you're quite used to.

40
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:44,918
Helping yourself, I mean.

41
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:49,212
Was that a crack or a compliment?

42
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,699
Which do you think it is?

43
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:55,784
Well, in my country I'd probably
consider it a compliment.

44
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,386
Here it's probably a crack.

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,733
And if you don't mind my saying so, 
I think that's a pity.

46
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,634
Well, I'm not really
in a position to argue.

47
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:07,210
The relative value of mushrooms
and oil in the world market today

48
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,221
being so unfairly what it is.

49
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:11,526
And don't try and turn the tables on me.

50
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:12,840
I apologize.

51
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:15,329
It's only that some of
the customs of this country

52
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,254
I find more unusual than others.

53
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,792
-Having no ice in my drink...
-Oh blast!

54
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:24,066
-I can make you some in two minutes!
-I really don't mind, honestly.

55
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,929
I don't complain until
it actually burns my tongue.

56
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,693
I'm really terribly sorry.

57
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:29,775
Would you...

58
00:02:29,835 --> 00:02:31,254
like me to fix you a drink?

59
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:34,791
Fix? You sound as if you're going
to drug me or something.

60
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,849
Sometimes I'm convinced

61
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,629
that the greatest barrier
between our two countries

62
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:40,745
is the bond of a common language.

63
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,123
Could I...

64
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:44,712
May I pour you out a drink?

65
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:47,755
No, thank you.
