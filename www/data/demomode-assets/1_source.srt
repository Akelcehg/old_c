1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,230
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:12,711
I seemed to have intruded.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,143
Yes you have, haven't you.

4
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:17,482
I was making the tour of the house

5
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:19,381
and I got kind of absorbed
in this little book.

6
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:20,649
I...

7
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:22,556
should have gone on
down the corridor I guess

8
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:24,807
but I made a mistake
and took the wrong turn.

9
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:27,688
I don't call entering a door
marked private making a mistake.

10
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:29,214
I call that trespassing.

11
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:30,435
You gonna prosecute me?

12
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,328
'Cause if you are
I shall defend the action

13
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:34,915
because there is no sign
on this door saying private.

14
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:36,406
Oh, yes there is.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,565
I beg your pardon.

16
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:43,878
No, I beg your pardon,
Ma'am. For intruding, I mean.

17
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:45,985
-Someone must've taken it down!
-Yes, Ma'am.

18
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:49,764
Yes, and in England we
only call the Queen Ma'am.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,742
In the United States
we try to make up for

20
00:00:51,796 --> 00:00:53,554
having no royalty
by calling everyone Ma'am.

21
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,235
And now would you be good
enough to put it back?

22
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:57,810
Put what back?

23
00:00:57,867 --> 00:01:00,294
The notice you remove from the door. 
It's there on the floor.

24
00:01:04,612 --> 00:01:05,664
Must've fallen down.

25
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:07,435
Rubbish, you put it there.

26
00:01:08,393 --> 00:01:09,850
I think I deserve an explanation.

27
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,890
Oh it's quite simple really.
As I had said, I spent a...

28
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,578
wonderful hour going
through your beautiful home.

29
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,663
You mean house, don't you?

30
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:19,592
You could hardly call a place a home

31
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:22,745
when people only have to pay two
and six pence to walk all over it.

32
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:26,775
So, not content with
seeing the public rooms

33
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:28,885
you wanted to see the private
ones as well, is that it?

34
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:31,847
Let's just say I was curious to
see the people who live in them.

35
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,513
Well, nowadays, I'm afraid

36
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:36,480
an Englishman's home is not his castle,

37
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:39,766
it's his income, and it's unfair
of you to take advantage of it.

38
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,956
Yes, Ma'am. I mean, no Ma'am.

39
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:45,662
I don't mean no Ma'am...

40
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,856
I just remember not to say Ma'am. 
That's all.

41
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:50,737
Yes, well. Don't
worry about it anymore.

42
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,082
Thank you.

43
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,526
You are Lady Rhyall, aren't you?

44
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:56,883
Yes.

45
00:01:57,402 --> 00:01:58,849
Well, I'm very glad to meet you.

46
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:02,822
How do you do.

47
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,996
Yes, you'd sort of have
to be, wouldn't you?

48
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:07,494
Why?

49
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,151
Well, you're perfect type-casting.

50
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:13,312
Don't tell me you're
in the film industry.

51
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:14,869
Hardly, no.

52
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:15,964
I'm an oil man.

53
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,923
-Oh, you're a millionaire!
-As a matter of fact, I am.

54
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:23,842
Won't you sit down?

55
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,261
Thank you.

56
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:29,043
Tell me, why were you so...

57
00:02:29,263 --> 00:02:31,126
why were you so sure
I was a millionaire?

58
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:33,780
Well, nearly all the
Americans I meet seem to be.

59
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:35,858
Especially the oily ones.

60
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:37,299
Well, I hoped you'd be impressed.

61
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,606
As a matter of fact, I am. 
Just a little.

62
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,632
Have you been a millionaire
for quite some time?

63
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,239
I guess I have at that.

64
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,815
Tell me,

65
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:48,669
Why do you think I'm type-casting?

66
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,003
Well you're cool and elegant.

67
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,402
You're at ease,

68
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,566
and...

69
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:00,009
And what?

70
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:01,763
And very lovely.

71
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:07,158
I suppose you're a millionaire because
you insist upon value for money.

72
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:09,968
I must say you are getting 
your half-crown's worth, aren't you?

73
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:11,677
I'm an American, I say what I think.

74
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:13,984
And hesitate before you say it.

75
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:16,136
A Frenchman 
would never have hesitated.

76
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,497
And an Englishman?

77
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:20,438
An Englishman
would never have said it.

78
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:23,887
You mean an Englishman would never
tell a married woman she was lovely?

79
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:25,460
No, no, I don't mean that.

80
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,769
It's just that he usually tells
the husband first.

81
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:29,612
What's the point in that?

82
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:32,159
Oh, because he knows the
husband will tell the wife.

83
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,344
"Do you know what old George
said to me last night, my dear.

84
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,311
"He said he thought you looked lovely".

85
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:39,193
I said very lovely.
